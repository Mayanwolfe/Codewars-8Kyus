//Max Headroom and JavaScript style

// Shouldn't the two functions getMax1 and getMax2 be equivalent and return the same value? Can you spot a problem and fix it? Can you learn something about JavaScript style in this kata?

//SOLUTION:

const getMax1 = () => ({ name: 'Max Headroom' })
const getMax2 = () => ({ name: 'Max Headroom' })
